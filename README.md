It's important to be consistent with your naming conventions to ensure clarity and ease of navigation for developers and users accessing your documentation.

- Model Documentation:
    - <model_name>_specification.md: Use the name of the model followed by "_specification" to indicate that it contains technical specifications for a specific model. For example, "image_classification_specification.md" or "sentiment_analysis_specification.md".

    - <code_topic>_documentation.md: Use a descriptive name that reflects the specific code topic or functionality. For example, "endpoint_deployment_documentation.md" or "data_preprocessing_documentation.md".
